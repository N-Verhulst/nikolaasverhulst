excerpt: The aim of this paper is to introduce a general framework which can be used to generalize both Appell sets in multivariate analysis and special polynomials in a complex variable $z\in\mathbb{C}$, inspired by certain special functions appearing in harmonic and Clifford analysis on Rm,. As an illustration, we have a closer look at Hermite polynomials.
